# mnist-Neural-network-basis-from-scratch
Problem statement
In this assignment, you will build a complete neural network using Numpy. You will implement all the steps required to build a network - 
feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc. 

You will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.
The assignment is divided into the following sections:
Data preparation
Feedforward
Loss computation
Backpropagation
Parameter updates
Model training and predictions
